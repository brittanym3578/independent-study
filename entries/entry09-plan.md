## Finally Finished
The project is finally finished, and I could not be more relieved. Working with my partners 
was a great experience and now we are just preparing our final step to completely be ready to present our project to the class.

## Presentation 
As we are looking back at our project we are thinking to ourselves, what are the major things we want our classmates to understand about our project?
We then realized that it would be better by going through with our teachers requirements but also have our presentation be visually appealing. 

## Takeaways
1) Always be organized because once you reach the end of your project you are gonna want to go back and remember the process.
2) Be happy with what you have made. There is always room to improve but you have worked so hard for 9 weeks.
