# Entry 1:
## Exploring SASS
Looking through many ideas in what I would like to study was very difficult for me at first until I ran into SASS. Generally, if I had to pick my favorite unit in my Software Engineering Program, I'd probably pick web design. 
The reason for this is because I loved seeing the amazing effects that CSS had on a plain HTML website. 
Incorporating CSS to a website really makes it visually entertaining so I figured that since I have a chance to elaborate on CSS and make a website or app more creative I would take the opportunity to learn it on a deeper level.  

## Motivation
Since I usually scroll around on the internet I was able to realize a variety of new and cool effects that many websites are using which made me wonder, how?
I instantly thought that it would be really nice if someone would say that about my website someday and would inspire the public to create a website of their own using SASS in order to make it more visually interesting/entertaining.

## Coding Process
SASS has its own way of style to write CSS with a .sass extension and removing curly brackets while styling your website.
Sass actually takes the concept of nesting one step further and allows you to save yourself the trouble of typing repetitive property names. 
Now, I questioned myself and wanted to know what made SASS different and I realized that:
- Sass syntax is similar to ruby
- Has no strict indentation
- The variable sign in sass is ! instead of $ 
- The assignment sign in sass is = instead of :

## Takeaways

Here are some of the takeaways that I had throughout my independent study for SASS
1. Over the past three days of week 1, I wasn't really that stressed because I found a topic that really caught my attention. Therefore, I realized that while I was in search for a topic I was mainly thinking of what I have done in the past and what really made me have a good time, and that would be web design. Since there were so many factors to choose from I found it hard to choose a specific one but when I looked over SASS I was instantly amused.
2. Although this is just week one I find it really helpful to start really investigating your topic and get yourself attached to it.
